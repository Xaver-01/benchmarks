- Disks:
  - initial complicated neighbor detection ~5.5s
  - 2 step neighbor detection: register all and filter by t value later (with large tThreshold 4.2s)
  - CPU like neighbor detection (register all and filter by distance) bit slower (4.3s)
  - CPU equivalent report actual t value and check neighbors explicitly (3.6s, reporting actual t value probably allows optix to optimize search pattern)
  - 2 step detection with tThreshold ~gridDelta ~3.7s
  - tighter AABB boxes leads to ~2.3s

  - gpu neighbor detection is fastest, followed by cpu-like, cpu-equivalent is slowest

- LevelSet:
  - no idea how it got so fast, i just replaced float3 with Vec3Df and did some other cleanup
