- All runs were done with the same config that is in this directory
- Same as config.txt from CPU holeEtching example

- List of fixes:
  - z dimension was not initialized to zero in 2D
  - Rays could immediately intersect the same disk twice after reflection (fixed by checking for t > ... inside IS kernel)
  - Backface hit logic is now identical to CPU version (1 backside hit ok, 2nd -> kill ray)
  - holeEtching: CH kernel used same materialID for closest hit and all neighbors but neighbors could be of different material

holeEtching:
- With deterministic parameters (120.981 rays, same RNG for ray generation, specular reflection, no pulls from distribution but just taking the mean value)
simulation results match up to floating point precision (s. ..._sameRNG.vtp)
- With random rays (everything else deterministic) results vary for both GPU and CPU in the same magnitude (s. ..._rndRays.vtp)
- With everything random the results match perfectly with slight variations based on RNG of course
- timestepsX.txt show the time steps for the default configuration (all random, using config.txt)
- GPU version uses CPU equivalent detection
